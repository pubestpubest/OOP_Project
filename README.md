## Project timeline (subject to change)
### Wed 24 Jan:
- **Design overview document for construction-plan evaluator due**
  - This includes the outline of class hierarchy for your parser and evaluator.
  - Your design will be given feedback, so you can address flaws before you submit your code.
### Wed 7 Feb:
- **Construction-plan evaluator due**
  - At this point, your project should be able to parse and execute construction plans, given a mock game state required for the execution.
- **Design overview document for game state and user interface**
  - This includes the outline of the display (view and controller) and your class hierarchy (model).
  - Your design will be given feedback, so you can address flaws before you submit your code.
### Wed 21 Feb:
- **Implementation of game state and user interface due**
  - At this point, your evaluator should be integrated with the game state.
  - At this point, your user interface should be displayable and can mock some construction commands
- **Design overview document for server-client implementation**
  - This includes the outline of the interaction between game state and user interface, including interaction between modules from other groups.
  - Your design will be given feedback, so you can address flaws before you submit your code.
### Wed 6 Mar:
- **Server-client implementation due**
  - At this point, your game state should be able to interact with user interfaces from other groups.
  - At this point, your user interface should be able to interact with game state from other groups.
- **Project report due**
  - Architectural overview of your system
  - Report on what was done according to plan and outside the plan
  - Retrospect on what was done well, and what could have been better
- **Possible extension: after the final exam period (no later than Wed 27 Mar)**
